# Virus-Beat
This is a tiny little game I made in half a day for the Indefinite Break Game Jam at IITK

## Rules
1. Stay clean, and collect as many resources as you can before they disappear.
2. Avoid all other humans.
3. If you come into contact with a sneezer - use a mask, with a hugger - sanitize.

That's it really. Try and stay alive as long as you can.
Oh and if you fall sick or get dirty, you will incur the wrath of the Guerilla Grannies.

## Notes from Dev
- If you reach a new high score, you will be appreciated by a PlateBanger

(This game was made by a bored Indian with a bad sense of humour.  To know more about Platebangers of India - click [here]())
- All the squiggly little sprites used in this game were handrawn by.. me!
- This game was made in a hurry, has no audio and lots of bugs. I might get back to this if I have the time, but I probably won't.
